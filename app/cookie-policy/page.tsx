What are cookies?

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how we use them. Cookies are small text files used to store small pieces of information. They are stored on your device when a website loads in your browser.

Cookies help websites function properly, improve security, provide a better user experience, and understand site performance so we can improve content and usability.

How do we use cookies?

Like most websites, we use first-party and third-party cookies for different purposes:

First-party cookies are typically necessary for the website to function properly and for saving your cookie consent choices. These cookies generally do not store personally identifiable information.

Third-party cookies (such as analytics cookies) help us understand how visitors use the site (e.g., pages viewed, time on site, and traffic sources) so we can improve the site.

We do not use cookies for logging into accounts (this website does not provide login functionality).

Types of cookies we use
Necessary

Necessary cookies help make the website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and saving your consent preferences. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

These may include cookies or local storage entries used by our consent management platform (CookieYes) to remember your choices.

Note: The exact names of necessary cookies can vary depending on your configuration and whether CookieYes updates their implementation.

Analytics

Analytics cookies help us understand how visitors interact with the website. The information collected is used to compile reports and help us improve the site. Analytics data is collected in a way intended to be non-identifying (for example, using aggregated reporting and/or anonymized identifiers where available).

If enabled, this site may use Google Analytics, which can set cookies such as:

Cookie	Duration	Description
_ga	2 years	Used by Google Analytics to distinguish users and measure site usage.
_ga_*	2 years	Used by Google Analytics to store and count page views / session data (property-specific).
_gid	24 hours	Used by Google Analytics to distinguish users for reporting.
_gat	1 minute	Used by Google Analytics to throttle request rate.

Important: Actual cookies may differ depending on whether you use Google Analytics directly, Google Tag Manager, Consent Mode, and the specific GA configuration. CookieYes can scan and populate the live cookie list.

Manage cookie preferences
Consent Preferences

You can change your cookie settings at any time by clicking the “Consent Preferences” button (or by reopening the cookie banner). This lets you review, update, or withdraw your consent.

Browser controls

You can also control cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to view, manage, delete, and block cookies for a website.
